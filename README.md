This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript 3: attempting to access a property of a null object.  The `bug.as` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected version.  Null pointer exceptions are frequent, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or data loading.  This example showcases how to properly handle potential null values before accessing their properties.
