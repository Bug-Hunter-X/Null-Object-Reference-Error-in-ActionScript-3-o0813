The error can be avoided by checking for null before accessing the property:

```actionscript
var myObject:Object = null;
if (myObject != null) {
  trace(myObject.someProperty);
} else {
  trace("myObject is null");
}

//Alternatively, using the nullish coalescing operator (available in ActionScript 3, but may require a newer Flash Player version):
trace(myObject?.someProperty || "myObject is null");
```

The `bugSolution.as` file provides both options, demonstrating how to handle a potential `null` object gracefully.  Remember to always validate your object references before accessing their members to prevent runtime exceptions.
